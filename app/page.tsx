            and our beloved dog, Pixel. As a graduate of UC Davis with a degree
            in Civil Engineering, my journey into the world of water resources
            began with a single fluids class that ignited my passion for the
            subject. Though I initially aimed to dive headfirst into the water
            resources field upon graduation, life had other plans when my
            father&apos;s health became a priority.

            In a twist of fate, I found myself drawn to STEM education, inspired
            by the dedicated educators who instilled in me a love for
            mathematics during my own schooling. For the past six years,
            I&apos;ve dedicated myself to teaching math and actively
            participating in school initiatives, cherishing the opportunity to
            share the joy of numbers with my students.

            Now, I&apos;m embarking on a new chapter as I make the pivot back to
            engineering, eager to merge my expertise in education with my
            engineering background. This journey represents the culmination of
            my diverse experiences and interests, blending the analytical skills
            honed through teaching with the technical knowledge acquired during
            my studies. As I delve into this exciting field, I&apos;m driven by
            a deep-seated desire to tackle complex challenges and make
            meaningful contributions to society.

            Outside of my professional pursuits, you&apos;ll often find me
            immersed in various hobbies and interests that fuel my passion for
            life. Traveling holds a special place in my heart, a passion
            instilled by my father, an immigrant from Macedonia who journeyed to
            the United States in pursuit of a better life. Over the years,
            I&apos;ve had the privilege of visiting over 18 countries. From the
            bustling streets of Paris to the beautiful beaches of Greece, every
            destination has enriched my perspective and deepened my appreciation
            for diversity. One of the most unforgettable experiences was
            swimming with sharks in South Africa, a thrilling encounter that
            exemplified my zest for life and willingness to embrace the unknown.
            Whether I&apos;m traversing distant lands or immersing myself in a
            new professional endeavor, this insatiable curiosity and passion for
            discovery are constants in my life.

            The adventures continue with my husband and I's passion for the
            great outdoors, whether we&apos;re hiking with Pixel by our side,
            camping in our trusty pop-up camper, or gliding across serene waters
            on our paddleboards. When we&apos;re not exploring nature, you can
            find us engaging in weekly puzzle nights and trivia challenges with
            friendsâ€”because I&apos;m always on the lookout for the next puzzle
            to solve or problem to tackle.

            Join me on this exciting journey as I blend my love for education
            and engineering into a unique skill set ready to make waves in the
