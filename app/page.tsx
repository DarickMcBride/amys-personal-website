            and our beloved dog, Pixel. As a graduate of UC Davis with a degree
            in Civil Engineering, my journey into the world of water resources
            began with a single fluids class that ignited my passion for the
            subject. Though I initially aimed to dive headfirst into the water
            resources field upon graduation, life had other plans when my
            father&apos;s health became a priority.

            In a twist of fate, I found myself drawn to STEM education, inspired
            by the dedicated educators who instilled in me a love for
            mathematics during my own schooling. For the past six years,
            I&apos;ve dedicated myself to teaching math and actively
            participating in school initiatives, cherishing the opportunity to
            share the joy of numbers with my students.

            Now, I&apos;m embarking on a new chapter as I make the pivot back to
            engineering, eager to merge my expertise in education with my
            engineering background. My husband and I share a passion for the
            great outdoors, whether we&apos;re hiking with Pixel by our side,
            camping in our trusty pop-up camper, or gliding across serene waters
            on our paddleboards. When we&apos;re not exploring nature, you can
            find us engaging in weekly puzzle nights and trivia challenges with
            friendsâ€”because I&apos;m always on the lookout for the next puzzle
            to solve or problem to tackle. Join me on this exciting journey as I
            blend my love for education and engineering into a unique skill set
            ready to make waves in the field.
